## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Among the things I was able to learn and practice in this project are:

- The insertion and positioning of two image elements as background, and playing a little with the different options provided by background.

Here are some examples:

```html
<body></body>
```
```css
body {
  background-image: url(../img/bg-pattern-top.svg), url(../img/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 75vh;
  background-position: top -40vh left -45vh, bottom -25vh right -45vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I continue practicing CSS, this is my eighth completed challenge, and in this work it was difficult to find the way to insert the images of the circles in the background, at the end I could do it but I think not in the best way, I know there are other ways and better, but I will continue working on this kind of details to find better ways for a better development.

## Acknowledgments

I thank Frontend Mentor for providing free resources to put into practice what I have learned, and above all a place to show them.
